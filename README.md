# Programming Languages Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects, assignments, and implementations from my Programming Languages coursework at Ariel University.

## Overview

The Programming Languages course explores the design, implementation, and theory of programming languages across different paradigms. This repository includes implementations, comparisons, and analyses of various programming languages and their underlying principles.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by language paradigms and assignments:

- **Imperative Languages**: Projects and examples in C, Pascal, etc.
- **Object-Oriented Languages**: Projects and examples in Java, C++, etc.
- **Functional Languages**: Projects and examples in Haskell, Lisp, etc.
- **Logic Languages**: Projects and examples in Prolog, etc.
- **Scripting Languages**: Projects and examples in Python, Ruby, etc.
- **Assignments**: Formal coursework assignments
  - **Assignment 1**: [Brief description]
  - **Assignment 2**: [Brief description]
- **Language Comparisons**: Analysis and comparison of different language features

- **Scheme/Lisp**: For functional programming and meta-programming
- **ANTLR**: For building parsers and language tools
- **LLVM**: For compiler implementation examples

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Depending on the language:
- C/C++ compiler (GCC, Clang)
- JDK for Java
- Python interpreter
- Haskell compiler (GHC)
- Prolog interpreter
- Scheme/Lisp interpreter

### Running Examples

Each language folder contains instructions for compiling and running examples:

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YairRaviv/Programming_Languages.git

# Navigate to a specific language example
cd Programming_Languages/Functional/Haskell

# Follow the README instructions for that language
```

## Example Projects

### Mini Language Interpreter

A small interpreter built from scratch, demonstrating:
- Lexical analysis
- Parsing
- Abstract syntax trees
- Evaluation

### Language Feature Comparison

A detailed comparison of how different languages implement:
- Inheritance and polymorphism
- Type systems
- Exception handling
- Concurrency models

### Custom Domain-Specific Language (DSL)

Implementation of a small DSL for a specific domain, including:
- Language design
- Parser implementation
- Interpreter
- Example programs
