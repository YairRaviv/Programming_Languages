# Programming Languages Repository

This repository contains a collection of projects, assignments, and implementations from my Programming Languages coursework at Ariel University.

## Repository Organization Note

This repository is organized by exercises, where each exercise is contained in its own folder (Exercise_X). This structure provides a clean organization of the different programming language concepts explored in each assignment.

## Overview

The Programming Languages course explores the design, implementation, and theory of programming languages across different paradigms. This repository includes implementations, comparisons, and analyses of various programming languages and their underlying principles.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by exercises and topics:

- **Exercise_2**: Implementation of a postfix AE interpreter and List Expressions (LE) parser and evaluator

## Key Topics Covered

- **Language Paradigms**:
  - Functional Programming
  - Object-Oriented Programming
  - Logic Programming
  - Imperative Programming

- **Language Design and Implementation**:
  - Syntax and semantics
  - Parsing and evaluation
  - Type systems
  - Abstraction mechanisms

- **Programming Concepts**:
  - List processing
  - Expression evaluation
  - Abstract syntax trees
  - Interpreters and compilers

## Exercise Details

### Exercise 2: Postfix AE and List Expressions (LE)

- **Postfix AE Interpreter**: Implementation of an interpreter for arithmetic expressions in postfix notation, including power and square operations.
- **List Expressions (LE) Parser and Evaluator**: Implementation of a parser and evaluator for list expressions with support for list, append, and cons operations.

## Technologies and Languages Used

- **Racket**: For functional programming exercises and implementation of interpreters
- **PL Package**: Extension for Racket providing type checking and language features

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Racket programming language with PL package installed
- DrRacket or another Racket environment

### Running Examples

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/YairRaviv/Programming_Languages.git

# Navigate to a specific exercise
cd Programming_Languages/Exercise_2

# Open the .rkt file in DrRacket or run it using the Racket interpreter
racket 316283043_315708370_3.rkt
```
